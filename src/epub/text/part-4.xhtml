      Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the
      pitiful? And what in the world hath caused more suffering than the follies
      of the pitiful?
    </p>

      Woe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above their
      pity!

      Thus spake the devil unto me, once on a time: “Even God hath his hell: it
      is his love for man.”
     </p>
    <p>
      And lately did I hear him say these words: “God is dead: of his pity for
      man hath God died.”—ZARATHUSTRA, II., “The Pitiful.”
